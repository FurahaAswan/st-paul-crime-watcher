### Project-level README.md
The project is built using a combination of front-end and back-end technologies. The front-end utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, it uses the frontend framework Vue.js. The back-end, powered by Node.js and Express, manages the database, and the core functionality of uploading and deleting crime data. This is done with a RESTFUL API that the front-end communicates with. This project was a great introduction to web development and taught me a lot. I learnt how modern single-page web application are created and what goes into making a streamlined UI.
